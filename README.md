APNG builder
==
Java API to create an Animated PNG file.

This is 'work in progress', created for the [Ganimed](https://github.com/Moon70/Ganimed) tool, therefore the current interface is very limited.

This version simply puts existing imagedata together and inserts the needed APNG chunks.

A future version will optimize the imagedata to reduce the file size.
