APNG builder
==
Java API to create an Animated PNG file.

Created for the [Ganimed](https://github.com/Moon70/Ganimed) tool, therefore the current interface is very limited.

This project is 'work in progress':

- **Version 0.0.1:** 
  Simply puts existing imagedata together and inserts the needed APNG chunks.
- **Version 0.2-SNAPSHOT:**
  Added own PNG encoder.
  Added APNG filtering.
  Added frame cutting.
